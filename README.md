# ANA 605 – Analytic Models & Data Systems

**Author:** Randall C. Crawford

This repository contains coursework completed for **ANA 605: Analytic Models & Data Systems**, a graduate-level course focused on building, evaluating, and comparing statistical models using real data and R Studio.

The course emphasized **how and why models work**, with particular attention to **variation, error, sampling, and inference**, rather than treating analytics as a black-box exercise.

### Core topics covered include:

* Exploratory data analysis of **quantitative and categorical variables**
* Mean (empty) models vs. **group and regression models**
* Linear regression with qualitative and quantitative predictors
* **Residuals, error decomposition, and model fit**
* Sampling variation and **sampling distributions**
* Simulation-based reasoning and the **Central Limit Theorem**
* **Confidence intervals** using both analytical and bootstrap methods
* Correlation, covariance, and coefficient of determination (R²)
* Model comparison using **PRE (Proportional Reduction of Error)** and the **F-ratio**
* Hypothesis testing, **p-values**, and Type I / Type II errors
* Connections between **t-tests, F-tests, and regression inference**
* Interpreting statistical results in applied, real-world contexts

Assignments and exercises required **hands-on analysis**, simulation, and written interpretation using statistical computing tools, reinforcing sound analytical reasoning and model evaluation skills.

This repository reflects applied analytical work developed throughout the course and demonstrates foundational competency in **statistical modeling, inference, and data systems**.
